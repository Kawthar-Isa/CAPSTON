# The Hidden Health Effects of Smoking
## 1.	Introduction
Smoking remains one of the most preventable causes of disease and premature death worldwide. It introduces thousands of harmful chemicals into the body, many of which are toxic and carcinogenic. The most well-documented and immediate target of smoking is the respiratory system, particularly the lungs. With every inhalation of cigarette smoke, the delicate tissues of the lungs are exposed to tar, carbon monoxide, and other toxins that damage airways, reduce lung capacity, and destroy the tiny air sacs (alveoli) essential for oxygen exchange.
Chronic exposure leads to serious lung diseases, such as:
•	Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) – including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.
•	Lung cancer – the leading cause of cancer death globally, strongly linked to tobacco use.
•	Asthma exacerbation and increased respiratory infections.
However, the damage from smoking is not limited to the lungs. Smoking affects nearly every organ in the body and is associated with a wide range of systemic health conditions, including:
•	Cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack and stroke.
•	Metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.
•	Liver and kidney damage, including increased risks of cirrhosis and chronic kidney disease.
•	Sensory impairments, particularly hearing loss and vision decline.
The widespread impact of smoking underscores the importance of comprehensive prevention and cessation programs, not only to protect the lungs but to preserve overall health and quality of life.

## 2.	Problem Statement
Smoking is a leading cause of preventable diseases and premature death globally. While its detrimental effects on the lungs are well-known, the broader medical implications of smoking across various body systems are often overlooked. This study aims to explore the extended health risks associated with smoking by analyzing its relationship with multiple chronic diseases using real-world population data.
## 3.	Objectives
•	Investigate the impact of smoking on the incidence and severity of multiple chronic diseases.
•	Identify disease-specific risk levels among smokers versus non-smokers.
•	Present visual insights into the distribution of health conditions by smoking status.

## 4.	Target Audience
•	Medical researchers
•	Public health policymakers
•	Clinical professionals
•	Anti-smoking advocacy groups

## 5.	Dataset(s)
This dataset from Kaggle contains medical examination records used to analyze the effects of smoking on various health indicators. It includes measurements such as blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, liver enzymes, vision, hearing, BMI, and more. The data was collected as part of regular health checkups in South Korea, targeting a large sample of adults. Each record is labeled with smoking status, allowing for comparative analysis between smokers and non-smokers. This dataset supports research into how smoking impacts different body systems beyond just the lungs.

## 7.	Analysis and Findings 
Metabolic Syndrome
•	10% of smokers are at risk of developing metabolic syndrome.
Vision Impairment
•	There is no risk for smokers to develop low vision.
Hearing Defect
•	Smokers show a 4% risk of partial hearing loss.
Liver Function Impairment
•	15.6% of smokers are at high risk for abnormal liver function.
Hypertension
•	8.3% of smokers are at risk of developing hypertension.
Diabetes
•	4.3% of smokers are at risk of developing diabetes.
Cardiovascular Disease
•	Smokers show a high overall risk for cardiovascular disease due to elevated cholesterol and hypertension levels.
## 8.	Recommendations
1-	STOP smoking
## 9.	Limitations and Assumptions
•	Cross-sectional Data: The study uses cross-sectional data, which limits causal inference.
•	Uncontrolled Confounders: Other variables such as diet, alcohol use, and genetics were not analyzed.
•	Self-Reporting Bias: Smoking status may be underreported by participants.
•	Scope Limitation: Focused on specific diseases and did not include cancer or respiratory diseases.
